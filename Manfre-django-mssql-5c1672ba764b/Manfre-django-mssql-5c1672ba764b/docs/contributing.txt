Project Goals
-------------

Django-mssql is a Microsoft SQL Server database backend for Django that is
meant to be run on Windows. Early development of this project was made possible
by the generosity of `Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC)`_, which allowed
me to spend time making improvements during business hours.

**Django Versions**

Database backends are very dependent upon Django's "internal APIs" that are not
subject to the standard deprecation cycles. At times, this makes it not
practical to support multiple versions of Django. Whenever this occurs, code
clarity and ease of maintenance are given a higher priority than supporting
older versions of Django. Patches that add support for legacy versions of Django
are less likely to be accepted.

An example of this is the various ORM changes that landed
for Django 1.6, which resulted in Django-mssql 1.5 dropping support for all
previous versions of Django.

**SQL Server Versions**

Support for older versions of Microsoft SQL Server will be dropped when its
convenient. This usually happens in response to Microsoft adding support for new
data types or other standard SQL features that allow for easier maintenance of
django-mssql. Whenever possible, the two most recent versions of SQL Server will
be supported with each version of Django-mssql to allow for an easier migration.

.. note::

	When I declare that django-mssql has dropped support for a specific version
	of SQL Server, this means that I am no longer testing it and will begin to
	remove any code specific to that version. Some projects that use that
	version may still work, but I strongly recommend not using it in production.


Getting the code
----------------

The project code and issue tracker are hosted on `Bitbucket`_. You can get the
code with the following command::

    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/Manfre/django-mssql/

If you are planning to submit changes, please fork the code on Bitbucket and
work against your fork. When your changes are ready, submit a pull request.

Pull Requests
-------------

Pull requests are the prefered method for getting changes in to django-mssql.
There are no set guidelines for what will be deemed an acceptable changeset and
commit message. A more descriptive commit message is appreciated. Before
starting a large or questionable change, please open an issue or contact me
directly to make sure there are no immediate red flags that would prevent the
change from being merged.

All changes will need to pass the full Django test suite
(See :doc:`testing <testing>`) before being merged.

Uploading to PyPi
-----------------

To build and upload the source and wheel packages to
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-mssql::
